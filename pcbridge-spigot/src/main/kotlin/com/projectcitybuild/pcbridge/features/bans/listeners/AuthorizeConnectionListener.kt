         * In order to call `event.disallow()`, this function must block until player data
         * has been fetched and processed. Blocking is not a problem because this event
         * handler function is called asynchronously by Spigot/Paper.
         *
         * The `event.disallow()` function works by mutating a boolean on the Event class instance.
         * The final value is read from the instance after all event handlers have had their turn.
         * However, event handlers are not suspending as they are Java functions. MCCoroutine gets
         * around this by immediately returning the event but allowing suspending functions to
         * continue execution in the background.
         *
         * Therefore, in order to call a mutating function, the event handler must be blocking so that
         * it awaits the result of the handler.
         *
         * See https://github.com/Shynixn/MCCoroutine/issues/43
